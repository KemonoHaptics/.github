# We are Kemono! ðŸ˜¼
We're making open-source, hardware agnostic body haptics for the masses. 

## About Kemono

Kemono is an open-source, hardware-agnostic, modular haptics manager designed primarily for virtual reality (VR) applications, though it is versatile enough to be used outside of VR as well. Our mission is to redefine immersion in VR by providing a flexible and extensible system that enables users to mix and match various haptic devices and software.

### Key Features:
- **Hardware Agnostic**: Kemono can work with any haptic device, as long as it vibrates. This means you can repurpose existing hardware or integrate new devices easily.
- **Modular Design**: With its plugin-based architecture, Kemono allows for easy integration of different input and output sources. Plugins can be created for any software that provides touch events (or more), and any hardware capable of providing haptic feedback.
- **Enhanced Immersion**: By allowing seamless integration of diverse haptic devices and input sources, Kemono aims to elevate the level of immersion in VR for everyone.
- **Community Driven**: Being open-source, Kemono thrives on community contributions. Users can create and share plugins, expanding the ecosystem and enhancing Kemono's functionality.

Our goal is to empower users to customize their haptic experiences by leveraging the hardware they already own or by incorporating new devices. Whether you're a developer looking to create a new plugin or an enthusiast seeking to enhance your VR setup, Kemono provides the tools and flexibility you need to make your vision a reality.

## Why Kemono?

### For End Users
Kemono's purpose is to provide the average consumer with a powerful, modular tool for haptics both in and out of VR. We designed the user interface to be functional, user-friendly, and visually appealing. Our goal is to make VR haptics accessible to the masses, ensuring that everyone can enjoy a more immersive experience without a steep learning curve. With Kemono, you can easily enhance your VR setup with a variety of haptic devices, creating a personalized and immersive environment.

### For Hardware Creators
Kemono's plugin architecture eliminates the need to reinvent the wheel and create yet another application for users to install. Instead, you can develop a plugin for Kemono, transforming your hardware into a software-agnostic haptic device. This means you no longer need to code support for every single game individuallyâ€”one device module can work with any input module. Additionally, we don't charge royalties for hardware that uses our application as a host, reducing your development workload at no cost to you. Your users benefit from an awesome user experience, and you can focus on innovating and improving your hardware.
