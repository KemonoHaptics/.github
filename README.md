# Kemono
Haptics for anything, really.

## Wtf is Kemono? / Why should I use it?
Kemono is a plugin-based haptics application designed for anything. Whether you want to use Joy-Con controllers for VRChat headpats, or some other absolutely absurd setup, we got you covered.

Here's some reasons you should use it, though.

- **Plugins.**
  You can make or install plugins that add more features to Kemono. Wanna have haptics in Resonite? Perhaps ChilloutVR, or even just a non-VR game? Make an input plugin! Wanna use some arbitrary hardware, maybe your grandma's old phone? Make an output plugin! No matter what you wanna make, as long as you can make it in C#, you can make it a plugin.

- **Modern UI.**
  Kemono was designed to be, first and foremost, user friendly. This means that the UI was designed to be modern, user friendly and simple to use. Nobody wants to be jumping through hoops to use an app, and so, you won't have to!

- **Open Source.**
  Kemono is fully open source software, as are the official plugins! You can rest easy knowing that we don't collect any identifiable information, and any information we *do* receive, you're always asked first if you consent.
  Check out our source, if you don't believe us!

- **Useful Documentation.**
  Kemono relies on the community creating plugins for the application, and so creating good and easy to understand documentation is critical for making sure people actually do! So we'll always make sure it's up-to-date and useful!

## Will you make a plugin for x or y?
It depends. I need to have the hardware / software in order to develop a plugin for it. If I don't have it, I may not be able to create the plugin for it. You're always free to, though!

## I have a problem! / I found a bug!
Oh no! Report it to us on Discord and we'll look into it! (By the way, [you can join our discord here](https://discord.gg/ySfpquUBRJ) :3)
